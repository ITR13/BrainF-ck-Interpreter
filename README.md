A BrainF*ck interpreter written in BrainF*ck  

Unfortunately I got the memo of bf only having an infinite band in one direction a bit too late, so this both requires and implements that.  
To see the final code check out [shortened.bf](https://github.com/ITR13/BrainF-ck-Interpreter/blob/master/shortened.bf).  
To see the "code" I used to wrap my head around it, check out [Graph](https://github.com/ITR13/BrainF-ck-Interpreter/tree/master/Graph), and to see the python code I used to transpile that into bf code, check the various python scripts in this folder.  
In [Tests](https://github.com/ITR13/BrainF-ck-Interpreter/tree/master/Tests) is a bunch of inputs and expected outputs (assumes infinite band), and in [Tester](https://github.com/ITR13/BrainF-ck-Interpreter/tree/master/Tester) is a go program I used to compare my implementation versus a few different ones I found on the internet.  

Keep in mind that it's been years since I wrote this, so it's possible it doesn't work anymore
